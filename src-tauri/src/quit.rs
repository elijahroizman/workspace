//! Quitting from outside the app's own Quit command (the Dock's Quit, logging out, shutting down)
//! must ask about unsaved changes too. AppKit asks the app delegate whether it may terminate, but
//! tao's delegate doesn't answer, so the app quit at once and unsaved work was lost. Writan adds
//! the answer: it cancels native termination and runs the app's own Quit command, which checks
//! the current editor state and asks (as TextEdit does, this stops a logout until you answer).
//! Always go through the page: a cached dirty flag sent over IPC can lag behind the last edit.
