# Changelog

Every release's notes. The release workflow copies a version's section into its GitHub release, and the app's update panel shows it.

## 0.10.4 — 2026-10-23

### Spreadsheets
- Choose how many rows and columns a sheet has: **Rows and columns** in the inspector has a field for each, up to Excel's 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns. The size is saved in the file, inserting or deleting rows and columns changes it to match, and it never cuts off cells you've used. Excel opens these files as usual.
- Pinch the trackpad to zoom the sheet.
- The Zoom section from 0.10.3 is gone from the inspector, and spreadsheets open at 100% again.

## 0.10.3 — 2026-10-23

### Spreadsheets
- **Zoom** in the inspector makes the sheet bigger: 100%, 125%, 150% or 175%. Every spreadsheet opens at the last zoom you picked, whether in the inspector, with the buttons under the sheet or with ⌘+ and ⌘−.
- New charts are back to 5 by 3 inches, and the chart inspector's Size section is gone.

## 0.10.2 — 2026-10-23

### Spreadsheets
- Building a formula by clicking cells works for as many references as you like. Before, typing a comma or operator after a clicked reference could put it in the wrong place, and the next click left the formula instead of adding the cell.
- New charts are bigger: 7 by 4 inches. The chart inspector has a **Size** section to set the width and height in inches.
- The **Chart** section sits under **Alignment** in the inspector.

## 0.10.1 — 2026-10-23

### Spreadsheets
- While you type a formula, the hint that shows what a function takes no longer gets in the way of the cells under it. Clicking them puts their references in, and the hint fades while the pointer is over it. Before, you could pick only the one or two cells beside it.
- Shift-click stretches the reference you just put in to a range, and ⌘-click (Ctrl-click on Windows and Linux) adds another after a comma, as in Excel.
- **Insert chart** sits near the top of the inspector, under the number format.

### App icon
- The Blue and Light icons are the same size as the default in the Dock and taskbar, with its margin and shadow. Before, they filled the whole space and looked bigger than the apps around them.

### Welcome tour
- The tour's pictures are screenshots of Writan, in light or dark to match the app, instead of drawings. The command palette's shows this computer's shortcuts.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-10-23

### Workspace is now Writan
- The app has a new name. Google's office suite is also called Workspace; Writan is ours. The icon and the look are unchanged.
- Updating keeps your settings, recent files, plugins and default apps. On a Mac the app keeps its place in Applications (a fresh install is Writan.app). On Windows it updates in place and the old shortcuts are replaced. On Linux the package is still `workspace`, so apt and dnf update it as before, and the command is now `writan`.
- **Settings › Appearance › App icon** picks the dark tile (the default), a blue one or a light one.

### Excel files and CSV
- Word, PowerPoint and Excel files now run on Writan's own engine, written in Rust. Excel workbooks and CSV/TSV files open in a new spreadsheet editor: sheets, a formula bar, number formats, fonts, fills, borders, alignment, merged cells, row and column insert and delete, and resizing.
- **Charts.** Select some cells and use **Insert chart** for a column, bar, line, area, pie, doughnut or scatter chart, made the way Excel would from the block. Drag to move or resize it; the inspector changes its type, stacking, title, cells, colors and legend. Charts in files from Excel show and stay as they were unless you change them.
- **Formulas like in Excel.** Typing `=` lists the functions, with what each one takes and a line on what it does; Tab puts the highlighted one in. While you type a formula, clicking or dragging over cells (on any sheet) puts their references in, and each reference gets its own colored box. Brackets left open close when you press Enter.
- About sixty more functions: SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, AVERAGEIFS, MAXIFS, MINIFS, IFS, SWITCH, XLOOKUP, XMATCH, MEDIAN, MODE, STDEV, VAR, LARGE, SMALL, RANK, EDATE, EOMONTH, DATEDIF, NETWORKDAYS, WORKDAY, TEXTBEFORE, TEXTAFTER and more. Newer ones are saved the way Excel expects.

### Home
- Open sits beside a New panel that lists every type you can make, so nothing gets squashed when LaTeX is on.
- Recent's filters are plain pills without colors. Office holds Word, PowerPoint, Excel and CSV/TSV files; Notes holds Markdown and text; PDF; Images holds PNG, JPEG and HEIC; LaTeX holds .tex files.
- In light mode Home shows the light logo. The dots in the top corners are gone.

### Windows
- Updating or uninstalling no longer stops with "Failed to kill Workspace". The installer waits for the app to close and ends it if it doesn't.

## 0.9.3 — 2026-10-20

### A new look
- A new icon: a W made of three blue sheets of paper on a dark tile. It sits beside the name on Home, too.
- Buttons, fields, dialogs and menus come from one set of shared pieces, so every screen matches. Primary buttons keep their blue when you point at them.
- Faint dots fade in from Home's top corners.

### Welcome tour
- The first-launch screen is now a short tour: the command palette, Word documents, presentations, PDFs, fonts and extensions, and split view, with default apps at the end on a Mac or Windows. **Skip tour** leaves it at any step, and **Settings › General › Show the tour again** brings it back.

### Version history
- Redesigned. Changes show as a page of the document: edited paragraphs are marked word by word, added ones in green and removed ones struck through in red. Unchanged stretches fold into a row you can click to open.
- Versions run down a timeline on the right. Right-click one, or use its **⋯** button, to name it, open a copy or delete it.

### Recent
- Home's Recent list filters by **Office**, **Notes** (Markdown and text), **PDF**, **Images** and **LaTeX** instead of one tab per file type. Folders are under **All**.

### Plugins
- Excalidraw, EPUB and Mermaid are gone, and their downloaded files are removed from your computer. Images is built in. LaTeX is still optional and off until you turn it on.
- The open-source licenses list matches: the removed plugins' packages are gone, and the image viewer's are listed with the app's.

### Polish
- The command palette matches words from their start, so "open" no longer finds New presentation. On Home, document commands show greyed out instead of missing.
- Esc leaves focus mode, and the hidden tab bar no longer leaves an empty band.
- Many labels, contrast fixes and sentence-case menus across Home, Settings, Word, PDF and PowerPoint.
- Recent paths read ~/Documents instead of Documents/~.

## 0.9.2 — 2026-10-20

### Find and replace
- **⌃H** (Ctrl+H on Windows and Linux) opens find with a **Replace with** field, in Word documents, presentations, Markdown and text files. **Replace** changes the highlighted match and moves on; **All** changes every one. The arrow at the left of the find box shows and hides the field.

### Lists as you type
- In Word documents, typing `- `, `* `, `1. ` or `1) ` at the start of a paragraph starts a bulleted or numbered list.

### One Open command
- **⌘O** opens files or a folder. On a Mac, pick a folder in the panel; on Windows and Linux, the dialog has an **Open Folder** button. Open Folder no longer has its own shortcut.

### Fixes
- Picking a spelling correction from the right-click menu in a Word document replaces the misspelled word. It used to do nothing, or type the correction at the cursor.
- Printing a Word document in dark mode gave grey text. Pages print black on white.
- On Windows, the title bar and menu bar take the app's colors, so the top of the window is one band instead of three shades.
- On Windows, the options in dropdowns such as the font list were light grey on white. They now use the app's colors.
- Commands in the command palette have their own icons (a sun and moon for appearance, a printer for Print…) instead of the Mac ⌘ symbol on every row.

## 0.9.1 — 2026-10-19

### Fedora
- Writan now comes as an `.rpm` for Fedora: `sudo dnf install ./Workspace-…x86_64.rpm`. It adds Writan's dnf repository, so new versions arrive with your system's other updates, and the **Update** button installs them with dnf.

### Fixes
- The setup screen fits in a short window. Continue no longer sits below the bottom edge until you go full screen.
- On Linux, the update panel names the right package (.deb or .rpm) and package manager.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-10-19

### Command palette
- **⌘K** opens one search box for everything: commands with their shortcuts, open tabs, recent files and the open folder's documents. Start with `>` for commands only.
- In Word, a link is now **⇧⌘K**, since ⌘K opens the palette. Settings › Keyboard Shortcuts can swap them back.

### Folders
- **File › Open Folder…** (⇧⌘O) shows a folder's documents in a sidebar beside the tabs, with search. ⇧⌘E hides it. Its **⋯** menu has Refresh, Collapse All Folders, Show All Files and Close Folder.
- Recent folders are in Home's Recent list, under All and their own Folders tab.

### Recent files expire
- Files and folders leave Home's Recent list 3 days after you last opened them. Pick 1, 7 or 30 days in **Settings › General**.

### Split view for Word and PDF
- **⇧⌘\** puts two Word documents or PDFs side by side, and asks which one goes beside the document in front: an open tab, a recent file, one from the open folder, any file, or a second copy of the same one.
- Each pane starts without its sidebar and inspector; the buttons at its corners show them. Markdown, Mermaid and LaTeX keep their own source-and-preview split, which ⇧⌘\ switches to.

### Version history
- Every save keeps a copy. **File › Version History…** (or right-click a tab) lists them by day, compares any version with now or with the save before it, and restores or opens a copy. Name a version to keep it for good. Settings › Autosave turns it off or clears it.

### PDF signing and forms
- **Sign** in a PDF's inspector places a saved signature or initials (drawn, typed or from a picture), the date or a check mark. PDF form fields can be filled, with a count and **Next empty**. **Save flattened copy…** bakes answers and marks into the page.

### Focus mode and typewriter scrolling
- **⌥⌘F** hides everything but the document and fades all but the paragraph you're writing. **⌥⌘T** keeps the line you're typing at the same height on screen.

### The workspace command
- `workspace .` opens the folder you're in, `workspace notes.md` a file. Install it on a Mac from **Settings › General › Command line**; the Linux package already has it.
- Opening a file or folder from the command line or Finder closes Settings (and the palette or version history) so you see it.

### Images
- **Line** and **arrow** tools. Hold Shift to keep one level, upright or at 45°.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-10-19

### Images
- A new optional plugin opens **PNG, JPEG and HEIC** pictures: zoom, fit to the window, and a few touch-ups (highlight, draw, box, crop, turn) with undo. ⌘C copies the picture, or the part you selected. An unchanged file is saved back exactly as it was.
- HEIC photos open for viewing (Writan can't write HEIC); **Edit a JPEG copy** opens one to mark up. Turn Images on in **Settings › Plugins**.

### Plugins and fonts in one place
- **Settings › Plugins** now has two lists, file types and fonts, each with a switch. The fonts moved there from General, and the list of built-in file types is gone.
- Six more optional fonts for Word and PowerPoint: **Ubuntu**, **JetBrains Mono**, **Atkinson Hyperlegible**, **Courier Prime**, **Instrument Serif** and **Comic Neue**. Each downloads when you turn it on and is checked before use.

### PDFs autosave
- PDFs now autosave like other files. Saving keeps your place, and autosave waits while you're typing into a form field or text box, or drawing. If you never changed the PDF setting, it's now on; turn it off in **Settings › Autosave**.
- Opening a LaTeX document's PDF in a tab again starts at the top; while you edit, it keeps updating where you are.

### Also
- A new app icon.
- The autosave status in the title bar is just a status; clicking it no longer opens Settings.
- Plugin engines (Excalidraw, Mermaid) are checked for new releases every week, and an update arrives as a pull request.

## 0.7.2 — 2026-10-18

> **LaTeX on Windows may still have bugs.** Installing TeX with winget, the MiKTeX fallback and turning the LaTeX plugin off on Windows are still being tested. If something goes wrong, please [open an issue](https://github.com/elijahroizman/writan/issues) with the message Writan shows.

### Linux updates through apt
- The .deb now adds Writan's APT repository, signed with its own key. New versions arrive with the rest of your system's updates (Software Updater, `sudo apt upgrade`).
- **Check for updates** on Linux can install a new version too: it asks for your password, installs with apt, and reopens Writan.
- If you installed 0.7.1 or earlier, install the 0.7.2 .deb once by hand. Updates come through apt after that.

### Dialogs
- Questions and alerts ("Save changes?", "Revert?", errors) are drawn by Writan instead of the system, so they look the same on macOS, Windows and Linux. Enter picks the highlighted button (Cancel when the other choice throws something away, as Revert and Delete do), Esc cancels.
- Deleting a custom theme asks first.

### LaTeX on Windows
- If winget can't install MiKTeX, Writan falls back to MiKTeX's own installer (checked against its published SHA-256). The error now includes winget's exit code and last message.
- Installing or removing TeX can no longer hang Writan: a step that takes longer than 45 minutes is stopped, and checking how TeX was installed gives up after a minute.
- Turning LaTeX off always works. Its question opens at once, and you can turn the plugin off while Writan is still working out whether it can also remove TeX.
- The install window can be hidden while TeX installs. **Settings › Plugins** shows the progress.
- Turning off a plugin with open tabs offers to close them, instead of telling you to close them yourself.

### Fonts
- **Michelangelus**, Microsoft's free typeface based on Michelangelo's handwriting, can be added in **Settings › General**. Microsoft's license doesn't let apps include it, so Writan downloads it from Microsoft and checks each file. It then shows in the Word and PowerPoint font menus.

### Also
- The PDF inspector's Document section is compact: each label and value share a row.
- The open-source licenses page credits T3 Code, which inspired the theme picker.
- Release notes are this changelog rather than a list of commits.
- Shorter README, with local development steps for Mac, Windows and Linux.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-10-18

- LaTeX installs TeX with Homebrew (Mac), winget (Windows) or apt (Debian, Ubuntu) when they're there, and offers to remove it when you turn the plugin off. A PDF opened in its own tab keeps updating. Errors wrap in the sidebar.
- Mermaid and LaTeX show errors in the sidebar only, and their sidebars match the rest of the app.
- Settings always opens on General. You can clear the file history and choose which file types get a tab under Recent.
- Appearance: a System option, color themes (two tones and an accent) and a theme creator.
- macOS window buttons moved down to line up with the tabs.
- A Debian/Ubuntu .deb is part of each release.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-18

- **Mermaid** (.mmd, .mermaid) and **LaTeX** (.tex) plugins. Both have a source and preview side by side, with the read / split / write switch Markdown uses (⌘E, ⌥⌘1–3).
- LaTeX compiles with the TeX on your computer (MacTeX, MiKTeX or TeX Live): in the document's folder, rerunning for references and running bibtex or biber. The PDF updates after you stop typing and shows in Writan's PDF viewer. Writan offers to install TeX when there's none.
- **EPUB** reader, a small plugin that comes with the app: one scrolling column, the table of contents in the sidebar, find, zoom, and it remembers your place.
- A plugin template and `npm run plugin:new` for writing plugins.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-18

- Plugins. Word, PowerPoint, PDF, Markdown and text are built in. Others are optional and off until you turn them on. **Excalidraw** is the first: it downloads from this repository's releases, and Writan checks its signature before installing it.
- A setup screen on first launch picks plugins and default apps. Settings has General (version, default apps, setup, open-source licenses) and Plugins pages.
- ⌘N asks which kind of file to make.
- Links in documents open in the browser again.
- Full-screen slideshows no longer draw lines twice or clip slide text.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-10-17

- Crop pictures in documents and presentations.
- ⌘-click (Ctrl-click on Windows) opens a Word link in the browser. Text typed after a link at the end of a paragraph no longer takes on the link's look.
- Resting the pointer on commented text shows the comment.
- Several picked slides can be deleted at once, in one undo step.
- New untitled documents take the lowest free number.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-17

- Word: headers and footers, and comments (add, reply, resolve, delete) saved in the file.
- PowerPoint: slide transitions with a preview, speaker notes, picking several slides or objects with shift- or ⌘-click, styling several objects at once, group and ungroup, layer order. Zoom keeps the slide in place.
- **Settings › Keyboard Shortcuts** lists every shortcut and lets you change it.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-10-16

- Autosave writes any file that already has a location back to it a few seconds after you stop editing.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-16

- The PDF editor runs on PDFium: faster zoom, page edits that apply instantly and can be undone, and less memory.
- The update panel shows the latest release's notes, and on a Mac the updated app reopens in the same Dock spot.
- The Mac app is signed and notarized.
- One Writan in the macOS Open With menu.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-16

- Word: links, page breaks, word count, table controls, and A4 for new documents.
- PowerPoint tables fit their frame and can be styled.
- Plain text (.txt) files.
- Embedding a YouTube video no longer crashes.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-10-15

- The downloaded Mac app no longer shows as "damaged".
- A tab's document loads the first time you look at it, so restoring a session is fast.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-15

- Windows: every shortcut works, labels say Ctrl/Alt/Shift, and the browser's reload keys are off.
- Automatic updates: checked after launch and every four hours, installed on quit or with **Restart to Update**.
- Pinch zoom follows your fingers.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-15

- First release: Word, PowerPoint, PDF and Markdown in tabs, each with its own sidebar and inspector. Native menus, Open With, session restore, printing, and light and dark themes.
