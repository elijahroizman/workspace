//! The contract the format layers (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) implement.
//!
//! The core reads what the formats share. A layer adds what only its format has: it reads its
//! own parts from the document's package, keeps typed data in [`Document::extensions`], can turn
//! the core's raw nodes into its own data, and writes all of it back. The core never depends on
//! a layer.
